## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Filippo, and I use this profile to push some projects I'm currently working on, as well as projects from courses I have completed.

I mainly work with Python and Jupyter, but I'm also looking to start learning and working with C++.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything further!

ðŸŒ± Always learning, always building.
